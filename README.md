This project applies symbolic regression to predict dissolved oxygen (DO) in inland waters using remote sensing proxies (temperature and NDVI). The workflow includes data preprocessing, hyperparameter optimization with random search, model evaluation, and result export. The best-performing interpretable equation is automatically selected based on RÂ² and MAE. Prediction results are saved in CSV for further analysis and visualization.
